# Car battery monitor

My car tends to eat batteries! Sometimes, particularly during pandemic
summers many weeks pass without the car being used, and during this
time sometimes the battery discharges. I suspect the underlying
problem is that somewhere current is leaking to ground, but that seems
hard to fix. Instead, Iâ€™d be happy to just monitor the situation and
charge the battery if needed.

The car is usually parked in range of the home WiFi network, so a
convenient solution would be to have the car send me email about its
battery every once in while.
